# HOTEL INFORMATION FETCHER IN ACCOMODATION.HTML

This project is a simple web application that advances the ZanziBliss website under accommodation bookings.

The application fetches hotel information using the hotels.com API and displays the information in a user-friendly manner.

Users can input domain, locale, and hotel ID to retrieve information about the required hotels.

## Known Issue: Undefined API Response

**Update (Date):** The project is currently experiencing an issue where the API response is returning `undefined` values instead of the expected hotel information. This can lead to the displayed content needing to be more complete.

**Cause:** The cause of this issue is still under investigation, but it's likely due to a discrepancy between the structure of the API response and the way the project is trying to access and display the data.

**Impact:** Users may not see the expected hotel information on the web page. The issue can affect the user experience and the application's intended functionality.

**Workaround:** While the issue is being addressed, you can consider reverting to a previous working version of the code, such as the one provided in the initial implementation section. The direct API call method works as expected and can provide accurate results.

**Next Steps:** The development team is actively working to identify and resolve the root cause of this issue. Updates and fixes will be communicated in subsequent versions of the project. We appreciate your patience and understanding as we work to improve the reliability of the application.

If you encounter any difficulties or have questions about this issue and ways to resolve it, please don't hesitate to reach out to the project maintainers through.
